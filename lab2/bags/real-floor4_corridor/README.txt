The bags in this directory contain real-world data collected as the robot was driven around the fourth floor of the UW CSE building. One could test their particle filter by replaying the bag (but not launching teleop.launch), launching a map server that loads the real-floor4_corridor map, and then running the particle filter. Note that it may be necessary to manually provide some parameters that were not recorded by the bag, such as the motor and servo gain and offset params.
